The LiteageOS Project

**Liteage** is a project designed to transform stock Android into a lightweight, LineageOS-like experience.  
It provides tools and scripts to modify the stock system by installing essential LineageOS apps and tweaks, making your device feel closer to the pure LineageOS environment without flashing a full ROM.

## How does Liteage work?

Liteage is **not** a full custom ROM.  
It modifies the stock Android system by injecting LineageOS apps and configurations, making your device behave and feel more like LineageOS without replacing the entire firmware.

---

## Project goals

Liteage is about **simplicity and functionality**, not flashy features.  
Itâ€™s for those who want a clean LineageOS-like environment built on top of stock Android, without the hassle of full ROM replacements.
